# All you need to learn Haskell


Functional programming is a lot of fun for rapid prototyping and scaling new ideas. But it’s also difficult to study if you’re brand new to the field.

People with prior experience in programming will have an easier time getting started, but once you get moving this can be a lot of fun. Haskell is one of the more interesting functional languages and if you have the temerity to learn I guarantee you’ll enjoy what Haskell can offer.

Functional Programming is about describing what the answer should be instead of describing how to get an answer. That is, it’s less about commands and more about expressions.

I decided to upload some of the resources I used to learn Haskell and become the Haskell mastermind I am today :). This collection includes material for absolute beginners, intermediate Haskellers, and more advanced programmers to ideally suit everyone’s needs.
